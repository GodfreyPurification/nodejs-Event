This code demonstrates the use of Node.js events by modeling a simple school system using the EventEmitter class from Node's events module.

The School class extends EventEmitter, enabling it to emit and listen for custom events. Within the School class, the startPeriod() method first logs "Class Started" to the console, then uses setTimeout to simulate a delay of 2 seconds before emitting a custom event named 'belling'. This event carries an object payload containing two properties: period: 'first' and text: 'period ended'.

In the main program, a new instance of School is created. A listener is registered for the 'belling' event using the .on() method. When this event is triggered, the callback function is executed, and a message like "we need to run because first period ended" is printed to the console. This message dynamically uses the period and text values passed with the event.

The system demonstrates an asynchronous event-driven pattern, common in Node.js, where one part of the code emits an event and another part responds to it. This allows for loosely coupled components that interact through events rather than direct method calls.

Overall, this code provides a clear example of custom event creation, event listening, and the power of extending EventEmitter for building reactive applications.
